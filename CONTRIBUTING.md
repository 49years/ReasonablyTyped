# Contributing Guide

## Creating an Issue

Please be descriptive and informative :smile: We're all volunteers here,
the more information you give us the faster we can fix your issue!

For feature requests, please check if there's an already existing issue.
If there is, feel free to give a :+1: on the issue! This will help us
prioritize, and reduce duplicate issues.

## Making a Pull Request

If you want to contribute and don't know where to start, checkout
the [ReasonML Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/reasonml). A
lot of contributors and helpful people hang around there. Also check out
our [Development Guide](https://github.com/rrdelaney/ReasonablyTyped/blob/master/DEVELOPING.md)
on how to work with the codebase.

When you're ready to make a PR, feed free to send it in! If anything is
wrong we'll help you out :heart:
